            In this unit you will investigate the features and uses of databases by exploring what they are and what you can do with them. 
            You will be able to apply some of your findings to your own database solution. You will also learn how to use database software to design, develop and test relational databases for a brief. 
            Once completed, you will review your database, having obtained feedback from others, and evaluate possible improvements
